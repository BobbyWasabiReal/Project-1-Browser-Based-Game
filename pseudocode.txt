2. Define the required variables
(Define the board, turn/score, mistake/lose, a sequence for bothe the player,
and computer, and whether or not the sequence is being played).

3. Cache the score element for later use
 (Play again button, and score)

 (One for each button on the board and pushes that choice to the pSequence array).

2. Play back the stored pattern (with audio).
3. Compare if the player's choice matches the computer's.
